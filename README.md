This repository provides a script for manipulating the UCI machine learning dataset.

The provided script requires the following dataset to be downloaded and extracted to the R working directory. https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The script will then import the relevant text files, revise the variable names, combine files into one file and summarise mean and standard deviation by subject and activity.

The final line exports the revised dataset to the working directory.
